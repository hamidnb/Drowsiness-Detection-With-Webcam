# Drowsiness-Detection-With-Webcam

This project detects drowsiness in real-time using a webcam and facial landmark analysis. By calculating the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) with OpenCV and dlib, it identifies prolonged eye closure and triggers visual alerts (flashing text, progress bar) to warn users. Ideal for driver safety or fatigue monitoring systems.
